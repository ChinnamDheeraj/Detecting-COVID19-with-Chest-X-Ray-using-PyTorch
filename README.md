# **Detecting COVID-19 with Chest X-Ray using PyTorch** 🦠📸  

## **Overview**  
This project implements a deep learning model using **PyTorch** to detect **COVID-19** from chest X-ray images. The model is trained on a dataset containing X-ray images of COVID-19-positive and normal patients.  

## **Dataset** 📊  
- The dataset consists of chest X-ray images categorized into:  
  - **COVID-19 Positive**  
  - **Normal (Non-COVID)**  
- Data sourced from **Kaggle** or publicly available medical datasets.  

## **Technologies Used** 🛠️  
- Python 🐍  
- PyTorch 🔥 (Deep Learning)  
- OpenCV 🖼 (Image Processing)  
- Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊 (Visualization)  
- NumPy & Pandas (Data Handling)
